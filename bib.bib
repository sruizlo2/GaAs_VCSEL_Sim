  abstract = {The AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterostructure system is potentially useful material for high-speed digital, high-frequency microwave, and electro-optic device applications. Even though the basic AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterostructure concepts are understood at this time, some practical device parameters in this system have been hampered by a lack of definite knowledge of many material parameters. Recently, Blakemore has presented numerical and graphical information about many of the physical and electronic properties of GaAs [J. S. Blakemore, J. Appl. Phys. 53, R123 (1982)]. The purpose of this review is (i) to obtain and clarify all the various material parameters of AlxGa1-xAs alloy from a systematic point of view, and (ii) to present key properties of the material parameters for a variety of research works and device applications. A complete set of material parameters are considered in this review for GaAs, AlAs, and AlxGa1-xAs alloys. The model used is based on an interpolation scheme and, therefore, necessitates known values of the parameters for the related binaries (GaAs and AlAs). The material parameters and properties considered in the present review can be classified into sixteen groups: (1) lattice constant and crystal density, (2) melting point, (3) thermal expansion coefficient, (4) lattice dynamic properties, (5) lattice thermal properties, (6) electronic-band structure, (7) external perturbation effects on the band-gap energy, (8) effective mass, (9) deformation potential, (10) static and high-frequency dielectric constants, (11) magnetic susceptibility, (12) piezoelectric constant, (13) Fr{\"o}hlich coupling parameter, (14) electron transport properties, (15) optical properties, and (16) photoelastic properties.             Of particular interest is the deviation of material parameters from linearity with respect to the AlAs mole fraction x. Some material parameters, such as lattice constant, crystal density, thermal expansion coefficient, dielectric constant, and elastic constant, obey Vegard's rule well. Other parameters, e.g., electronic-band energy, lattice vibration (phonon) energy, Debye temperature, and impurity ionization energy, exhibit quadratic dependence upon the AlAs mole fraction. However, some kinds of the material parameters, e.g., lattice thermal conductivity, exhibit very strong nonlinearity with respect to x, which arises from the effects of alloy disorder. It is found that the present model provides generally acceptable parameters in good agreement with the existing experimental data. A detailed discussion is also given of the acceptability of such interpolated parameters from an aspect of solid-state physics. Key properties of the material parameters for use in research work and a variety of AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs device applications are also discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Practical applications implementing integrated photonic circuits can benefit from nonlinear optical functionalities such as wavelength conversion, all-optical signal processing, and frequency-comb generation, among others. Numerous nonlinear waveguide platforms have been explored for these roles; the group of materials capable of combining both passive and active functionalities monolithically on the same chip is III--V semiconductors. AlGaAs is the most studied III--V nonlinear waveguide platform to date; it exhibits both second- and third-order optical nonlinearity and can be used for a wide range of integrated nonlinear photonic devices. In this review, we conduct an extensive overview of various AlGaAs nonlinear waveguide platforms and geometries, their nonlinear optical performances, as well as the measured values and wavelength dependencies of their effective nonlinear coefficients. Furthermore, we highlight the state-of-the-art achievements in the field, among which are efficient tunable wavelength converters, on-chip frequency-comb generation, and ultra-broadband on-chip supercontinuum generation. Moreover, we overview the applications in development where AlGaAs nonlinear functional devices aspire to be the game-changers. Among such applications, there is all-optical signal processing in optical communication networks and integrated quantum photonic circuits.},

  abstract = {A series of AlxGa(1-x)As ternary alloys were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at the technologically relevant composition range, x \&lt; 0.45, and characterized using spectroscopic ellipsometry to provide accurate refractive index values in the wavelength region below the bandgap. Particular attention is given to O-band and C-band telecommunication wavelengths around 1.3 {\textmu}m and 1.55 {\textmu}m, as well as at 825 nm. MBE gave a very high accuracy for grown layer thicknesses, and the alloys' precise compositions and bandgap values were confirmed using high-resolution x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence, to improve the refractive index model fitting accuracy. This work is the first systematic study for MBE-grown AlxGa(1-x)As across a wide spectral range. In addition, we employed a very rigorous measurement-fitting procedure, which we present in detail.},
