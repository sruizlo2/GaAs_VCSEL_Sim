  abstract = {In this paper a detailed investigation of the distributed Bragg reflectors in GaAs-based vertical cavity surface emitting lasers is presented. The influence of layer doping concentration, number of periods, oxide aperture and Al               x               Ga               1-x               As alloy composition on output emission power and threshold current has been found. Both oxidized and non oxidized structures have been considered. A number of interpolation curves are extracted and presented for design and fabrication purposes. Although the results are presented for GaAs-based structures, the theoretical approach is very general.}
